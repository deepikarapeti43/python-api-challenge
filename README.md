# python-api-challenge
 This is a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. 
 Part 1 : WeatherPy Requirement 1: Create Plots to Showcase the Relationship Between Weather Variables and Latitude To fulfill the first requirement, you'll use the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data from the cities list generated in the starter code.

Next, you'll create a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships: Latitude vs. Temperature Latitude vs. Humidity Latitude vs. Cloudiness Latitude vs. Wind Speed

Requirement 2: Compute Linear Regression for Each Relationship To fulfill the second requirement, compute the linear regression for each relationship. Separate the plots into Northern Hemisphere (greater than or equal to 0 degrees latitude) and Southern Hemisphere (less than 0 degrees latitude). You may find it helpful to define a function in order to create the linear regression plots.

You should create the following plots: Northern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude Southern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude Northern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude Southern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude

Part 2: VacationPy

we use your weather data skills to plan future vacations. Also, you'll use Jupyter notebooks, the geoViews Python library, and the Geoapify API. The code needed to import the required libraries and load the CSV file with the weather and coordinates data for each city created in Part 1 is provided to help you get started.
